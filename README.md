GitHub Guides Hello World Introduction

My name is Michael Wade Johnson, a student at Tarrant County College.
This is a part of my final exam project for a Java Programming
course I am finishing. After this course I plan to focus specifically
on Java as its one of the most requested, diverse, and so far the most
difficult language I have yet to learn. I hope to study and know Java language
as well as I known my mother tounge for a successful fuure in Java and the 
programming industry.
